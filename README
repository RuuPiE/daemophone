daemophone is an iPad MPD client, with source released under the GNU
GPL. It's not finished yet, but its feature list is growing rapidly.

it uses the generously licensed libmpdclient, from

information about the next song and to do zero-blocking idle calls.

It currently also uses many icons from The Working Group,
(http://blog.twg.ca/2010/11/retina-display-icon-set/), under a
Creative Commons license, and the default album art from Theremin
(https://theremin.sigterm.eu/), a GPL'd Mac OS X MPD client.
