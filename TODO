Here's a place for me to dump what I still need to do, as it occurs to me.

volume setting
seeking
sane seek bar positioning

playlist load/save
playlist clear
playlist item reordering/removing
better playlist reload animations (?)
continuous artist/album subtitle regions

non-hack way to let users know the popover is placed non-standard

multiple server support

mpd settings page
crossfade
outputs

add by filename browser
add by metadata
add URI
append/replace toggle (or not, have them just clear playlist)
load playlist from URI (put with playlist stuff?)

default launch image
about page (licenses, ...)
